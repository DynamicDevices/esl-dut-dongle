# Hardware Design Examples

This directory contains example hardware design files used for investigation and capability testing.

## Purpose

These examples are used to:
- Investigate PCB design tools and workflows
- Test documentation approaches
- Explore design file formats
- Develop design processes

**These are NOT the actual hardware design files.**

## Directories

- `pcb-design-investigation/` - Example PCB design documents for capability investigation

## Actual Hardware Design

The real hardware design files will be located in:
- `hardware/schematics/` - Actual schematic design files
- `hardware/pcb/` - Actual PCB layout files
- `hardware/3d-models/` - Actual 3D models

These will be created once the design specification questionnaire is completed and requirements are finalized.
