# PCB Design Capability Investigation

## Purpose

This directory contains example PCB design documents created to investigate PCB design capabilities and tools. **These are NOT the actual hardware design files** - they are examples used to explore:

- PCB design workflow
- KiCAD file formats and structure
- Design documentation approaches
- Tool integration possibilities

## Contents

- `schematics/` - Example schematic design documents
- `PCB_DESIGN_STATUS.md` - Example design status tracking

## Status

**This is an investigation/example project only.**

The actual hardware design will be created in `hardware/schematics/` and `hardware/pcb/` once the design specification questionnaire is completed.

## Notes

- Design assumptions are based on initial research
- Will be replaced with actual design once requirements are finalized
- Used to test documentation and design workflow approaches
